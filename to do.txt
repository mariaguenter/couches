TO DO:

Write ups (mardog got this)
make the search button in the footer link to the search bar on home page
hover color on submit buttons -> #FF3B3F; with white text
make the search bar wider when clicked
contact page make "message" a text area thingy not just text
make the labels on all forms (log in and contact) on top not beside (use mat's top class??)
CLIENT SIDE VALIDATION (MAT?? OMG I HAVE NO IDEA HOW) -just check that any input isnt left blank and thats it. nothing fancy 
Thread post page?!? maybe??


later maybe:
click profile picture -> open bigger window
add thumbs up icon and rating beside posts
