TO DO:


fix home page so it works on maria's screen (mat)
make the search bar wider when clicked
contact page make "message" a text area thingy not just text
change picture upload buttons
CLIENT SIDE VALIDATION (MAT?? OMG I HAVE NO IDEA HOW) -just check that any input isnt left blank and thats it (oh and check that password and confirm apssword are the same). nothing fancy (JUST JAVA SCRIPT) 



later maybe:
click profile picture -> open bigger window
add thumbs up icon and rating beside posts
make the search button in the footer link to the search bar on home page (i tried and couldnt figure it out, we cant just get rid of this if its too hard)
