impliment/import database witch craft (mat)
once database up - fill it with some stuff (maria)
once database up - make log in/create account/comment/submit post/home page/profile actually link to database (i thiiink I can handle that)
home page categories filters (maria?? maybe??)
make forgot password into an email recovery thing, that also uses the security question they gave (mat)
make the search bar actually search stuff (mat impliment, maria could potentially write the sql for it...)
admin page - search users/enable or disable users/ edit/remove psots or users (mat?) lets make this a VERY ugly basic page. aka no css
